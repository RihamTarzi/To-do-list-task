# To-do-list-task
To-Do List task, I have successfully built the page with the following features:  A simple input field to add new tasks. A grid list that displays the added tasks. The ability to edit and delete tasks, with appropriate icons for each. I used local storage to store the tasks so they persist even after the page is refreshed.
